# Loops
Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is met. The basic idea behind a loop is to automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort. JavaScript now supports five different types of loops:

-   **[[while]]** — loops through a block of code as long as the condition specified evaluates to true.
-   **do…while** — loops through a block of code once; then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition is true.
-   **[[for]]**— loops through a block of code until the counter reaches a specified number.
-   **for…in** — loops through the properties of an object.
-   **for…of** — loops over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, etc.
