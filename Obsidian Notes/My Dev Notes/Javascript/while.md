# While Loop
Loops through a block of code as long as the condition specified evaluates to true

The **`while`** loops statement structure is:
```javascript
while(_condition_) {  
    _// Code to be executed_  
}
```


Example:
```js
var i = 1;

while(i <= 5) {
	document.write("<p>The number is " + i + "</p>");
	i++; 
	}
```

The example returns 
	`The Number is 1
	`The Number is 2
	`The Number is 3
	`The Number is 4
	`The Number is 5
