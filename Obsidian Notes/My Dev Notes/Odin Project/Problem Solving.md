# Problem Solving
Basic steps for how to approach a programming problem/challenge. 

1. **Understand**
	1. Know your problem. Write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it
2. **Plan**
	1. Write down your exact steps.
	2. Answer the question, “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
3. **Divide**
	1. Do not try and solve one big problem, break it down in to sub-problems
	2. Solve each one by one and then connect them.
4. **Stuck**?
	1. **Debug**: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
	2. **Reassess**: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
		1. Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
	3. **Research**: Google/Stack Overflow for an answer.  Do not look for a solution to your big problem, only your sub-problem.  You need to  struggle to learn and grow into a better programmer. Don't waste time and just find solutions without learning. 
5. **Practice** - Micro Problem-Solving
	1. Chess, Coding Challenges (Coderbyte), Video Games, Sudoku, Math problems.
