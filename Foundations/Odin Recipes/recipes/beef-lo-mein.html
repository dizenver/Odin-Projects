        <li>5 pieces napa cabbage leaves , chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the steak with the marinade ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Mix until well coated and marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package instructions. Rinse under running cold water to stop cooking. Drain and toss with a drizzle of sesame oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a large skillet and heat over high heat until hot. Spread the marinated steak without overlapping. Cook without disturbing until the bottom turns golden brown, 1 minute or so. Flip to cook the other side until browned but the inside is still a bit pink. Transfer the beef onto a big plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-high and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the garlic. Stir a few times to release the fragrance, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the white part of the green onion, onions, carrots, and cabbage. Stir fry until the cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles and drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon oil on top. Toss the noodles a few times to mix with the oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in the sauce and toss together everything.</li>
        <li>Add back the cooked steak and toss again, until the sauce is fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add the bean sprouts and green onion greens. Stir a few times until the bean sprouts just wilted but remain crispy.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything to serving plates and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
